# 🐾 Animal Prediction Using PyTorch

This project demonstrates a custom image classification model built using PyTorch. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of animals into predefined categories.

## 📌 Features

- Custom CNN built from scratch using PyTorch
- Data loading using `torchvision.datasets.ImageFolder`
- Model training and validation with accuracy tracking
- Optimizer: Adam
- Techniques used: Batch Normalization, Weight Initialization
- Easily extendable to new datasets or classes

## 🧠 Goals

The main purpose of this project is **to learn and deepen understanding of deep learning fundamentals** by building models without relying on high-level training frameworks.
